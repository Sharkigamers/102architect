# 102architect

## Description 

You are working on a homeplanning software for an architecture firm. The goal is to simplify the process of
drawing the plan, and to integrate various features such as scale management, changing the point of view,
moving doors and windows along walls. . . You are in charge of implementing the geometric transformations (rotation to change point of view, translation to move an object, scaling to zoom in and out, reflection
and any combination of these transformations).

## Usage

```make && ./101pong x0 y0 z0 x1 y1 z1 n```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Desription |
|-----------|------------|
| x0   | ball abscissa at time t - 1 |
| y0   | ball ordinate at time t - 1 |
| z0   | ball altitude at time t - 1 |
| x1   | ball abscissa at time t |
| y1   | ball ordinate at time t |
| z1   | ball altitude at time t |
| n    | time shift (greater than or equal to zero,integer) |
